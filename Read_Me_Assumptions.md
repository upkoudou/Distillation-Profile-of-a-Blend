Assumptions

In this serie of computation, two datasets will be used to perform two regressions analysis. 
We consider the following assumptions to be validated :
- Linear relationship : the relationship between the independent and dependent variables needs to be linear.
- Multivariate normality : observations are normaly distributed 
- Indepent error : implies no correlations in the errors (residuals)
- Homoscedasticity: the residuals accros the regression line are aquls

1. Given any two crude oils with their given distillation profiles, create a model which will give an approximate distillation
profile of the mixture of the two oils with specified volumes. [...]





2.Collect data from Crude Monitor for a couple of real crudes, and cleaning recent data, run the distillation
profiles through your program with volumes of your choosing.
